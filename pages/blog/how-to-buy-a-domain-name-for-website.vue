    <p>Any digital project starts with finding a good domain for the future website. To keep your website name
      memorable, there are a number of things to consider before registering a domain. In this article, we talk in
      detail about how to get a domain name and choose a domain zone for your online resource.</p>

    <h2 id="When Should I Buy a Domain Name">When Should I Buy a Domain Name</h2>
    <p>Buying a domain name is not always dictated by the need to create a website. A well-chosen and timely acquired
      domain can become an asset no worse than stocks or currencies, the value of which periodically falls, and the
      value of the domain name only moves up.
    </p>
    <p>Domain is the first thing that a visitor sees when entering your site. A well-chosen name makes a good impression
      on the visitor, is easy to remember and increases brand awareness. The domain name affects the promotion of your
      website. This applies to both the domain name itself and the competent choice of the domain zone. So, the brand
      name and keywords in the title affect the ranking of the site in the search results.</p>
    <p>Domains gain reputation in search engines over time, which affects their ranking in search results. Therefore, it
      is better to correctly choose a domain right away than to change it in the future. </p>
    <p>So, where should you start to buy a domain name? Let’s see how to choose the best place to buy a domain name.</p>

    <h2 id="Find a Domain Registrar">Find a Domain Registrar</h2>
    <p>There are billions of registrar services today, but you have to trust only the accredited. One of the most famous
      such services in the world is godaddy. Previously, this registrar had some of the most attractive prices,
      discounts and promotions were offered, although now you can find good and profitable options here. Another popular
      registrar is namecheap. Already in the name there is a hint of low prices.</p>
    <h2 id="Search for a Domain Name">Search for a Domain Name</h2>
    <p>Where can I buy a domain name? There are special services where you can search for and get a domain name that
      suits you best. When choosing a domain for a website, keep in mind the purpose of the site and its type. Each
      topic and site type (eCommerce, informational, etc) requires a different name.</p>
    <p>The domain name of an information site should reflect its subject matter. You don't have to describe it
      literally. For example, you shouldn't call a site about houseplants "flowerswebsite." You can select words that
      provide associations with topics. For example, for a site about houseplants, you might choose the name of a
      specific houseplant.</p>
    <p>If you’re about to start a company or business website, the first and most obvious option is to take the name of
      the company as the domain. If that domain is already in use, you might consider adding the words like company,
      agency, business, etc to specify your brand.</p>
    <p>Another option is to reflect the essence of the company's activities in the domain name. Here you need to strike
      a balance between the breadth and narrowness of the subject matter. Let's say you are selling different goods, but
      one type of goods prevails in the assortment. For example, you sell different materials for repairing, but the
      majority of the goods are wallpaper.</p>
    <p>For eCommerce sites and online retailing, the rules are a bit different. The domain name of the online store
      should reflect its profile. If the store is a huge online platform like Amazon, then it is better to choose a
      unique and easy to remember word.</p>
    <p>When deciding which domain name to choose for your online store, give preference to short names because they are
      easier to remember.</p>
    <h2 id="Buy the Domain You Like">Buy the Domain You Like</h2>
    <p>Once you've found an available and proper domain name, proceed to make a purchase. If you buy from a registrar,
      you will need to fill out several forms with personal information, contact details and pay for services. As soon
      as the money is transferred, you immediately become the owner of the address.</p>
    <p>All domain names are registered with ICANN (International Organization for Assigned Numbers and Names). It is the
      repository of a centralized database with addresses and it determines the availability or inaccessibility of the
      domain name extension for the site owner.</p>
    <h2 id="Some More Tips to Follow">Some More Tips to Follow</h2>
    <p>Optionally, you can register a 63 character name. But Google recommends using up to four words for
      efficiency.</p>
    <p>Choose a unique domain name that doesn't look like anything and is certainly not copied from another resource. Be
      sure to check the domain name you buy for being blacklisted by search engines. If you were lucky enough to get a
      domain that is banned, be ready for a long and tedious way to get out.</p>
    <p>It is also believed that the shorter the domain name is, the better it is for the website’s performance. For
      users, short domains look attractive and easy to remember.</p>
    <p>When using a geographic domain zone, try to think several steps ahead, imagine where you plan to operate in the
      future. For example, if you are currently working in a certain region, but dream of expanding to a national and
      international scale, you should not limit yourself to regional domain zones.</p>
    <p>When choosing a domain, make sure that the name does not violate the copyrights of third parties. Otherwise, it
      may lead to a demand from the trademark owner to remove the domain or transfer the name to them.</p>
    <p>Rent a domain for a longer period. The minimum lease term for a domain name is usually at least one year. Often
      this time is enough for a business to spin up or make a decision to close it. If you are confident about your
      project, feel free to take a domain for a couple of years. It’s good from the SEO point of view, because search
      robots perceive such domains as more serious and developing and give them preference in the search results. And
      secondly, this way you increase your chances that the domain will definitely not be redeemed by other potential
      owners after a year.
    </p>
    <p>The easiest way to make a domain unique is to use a brand or company name. A brand name that is not tied to a
      specific product or service will liberate your actions in the future when you decide to expand your business.</p>
    <p>A domain name, however, can be any word. A random set of words also works if its sound catches the ear. Having
      come up with something original, you need to check if there is a similar one in the domain that you have chosen,
      as well as in others. This will protect you from unfair competitors, and the choice of a domain and the subsequent
      registration of a domain name will secure your right to own it.</p>
    <h2 id="Mistakes You Should Avoid">Mistakes You Should Avoid</h2>
    <p>The most common mistakes you need to avoid when choosing a domain are:</p>
    <ul class="dots">
      <li>Incorrect selection by thematic or geographic characteristics;</li>
      <li>Too long or non-understandable name;</li>
      <li>Similarity to competitors;</li>
      <li>Misspelling of the word or overusing of hyphens and numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Choosing a domain for a website is an important stage when starting any project. For all its seeming simplicity,
      this process requires the concentration of the efforts of the entire team and especially the SEO specialists.
    </p>
    <p>You can deal with it easily if you follow the tips above and get a website that will be best for your case.</p>
