    <p>A domain name is more than just your website address. This is the idea of the business, your identity, the online
      identity of the company. Domain is the strongest marketing tool.</p>
    <p>Even one word makes up a domain name that can significantly affect the user's decision to visit the site or not
      even open it. A domain name forms the first impression of the brand and remains forever in the memory of a
      person.</p>
    <p>Domain name is a very important indicator that can affect the SEO and positions of your site (both for better and
      for worse). So, does domain name help SEO promotion?</p>

    <h2 id="About Domain Names" style="margin-top:100px">About Domain Names</h2>
    <p>When choosing a domain for a site, one involuntarily wants to bind it to something: to the topic of the site, to
      the place of residence, to a well-known word. This is understandable, because we want the domain to be
      recognizable and memorable. But what’s up with the connection between domain name and SEO optimization?
    </p>
    <p>Let's start from the very beginning. A domain name is an alias. Assigning it is a convenient way to point people
      to a specific area on the Internet where you created your site. Domain names are generally used to identify one or
      more IP addresses.</p>
    <p>The site starts with a domain, so the first step is to decide on the name of your resource. Whether a domain name
      influences website promotion is a question to which different experts will give different answers. Most people
      think that keyword domains lost their relevance many years ago. At the same time, the name of the resource affects
      the attractiveness of the snippet, increasing the click-through rate in the search results. But all marketers
      agree that the name should be short, capacious and memorable. </p>
    <h4>Domain name structure</h4>
    <p>The domain name includes several separate words, which are separated by periods. Based on the number of words,
      you can determine the level of a domain: second, third and fourth. There may be more levels, but it is better not
      to use such options.
    </p>
    <p>Conventionally, the address can be divided into three main parts:</p>
    <ul class="dots">
      <li>Domain zone;</li>
      <li>The name of the page itself (name of the company, brand, etc.);</li>
      <li>Subdomain. It is optional and is used to isolate information.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Domain zones specification</h4>

    <p>First-level domains are subdivided into state domains and general purpose domains. There are also service
      domains, but they are only used for specialized sites. The category of domain names of general importance is
      divided into domains, which are divided according to characteristics.</p>

    <h4>What is the best domain zone to choose?</h4>
    <p>To choose a domain zone correctly, you need to answer 3 main questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>1. Does the site correspond to the thematic subsections existing in the domains?</li>
      <li>2. Are there any restrictions on the activity or audience of the site?</li>
      <li>3. Are there any restrictions on sub-regional zones?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Based on the responses received, choose a domain zone, having correctly prioritized the formation of conflict
      cases. When choosing and registering a domain, additionally register similar names that are available and existing
      in all zones so that your competitors do not get ahead of you by registering an address similar to yours and do
      not reap the benefits of getting your customers.</p>
    <h2 id="How Domain Name Helps With SEO">How Domain Name Helps With SEO</h2>
    <p>When ranking sites, search engines take into account many factors, including domain information.</p>
    <h4>What search engine crawlers pay attention to</h4>
    <p>There are some key things when a domain extension does affect SEO:</p>
    <p><strong>Domain history.</strong> If the site was previously used to sell links, but now you have decided to tidy
      it up, then it
      will be difficult to take high positions in the search results. Also, if the topic on the site has been changed,
      for example, there used to be an online shoe store, and now there is a blog about flowers, then the domain history
      is being reset.</p>
    <p><strong>Age.</strong> When choosing a domain name for SEO promotion, keep in mind that search engines prioritize
      older sites over
      younger ones. The Google ranking algorithm distinguishes sites that are more than 1-3 years old. Young websites
      first need to gain the trust of the search engines.</p>
    <p><strong>Name. </strong>The name of the site shouldn’t be spammed with keywords, or it will be harmful for your
      indicators.</p>
    <p><strong>Domain zone.</strong> This depends directly on the specifications of your website and if you want to go
      international or stay a local business.</p>
    <h2 id="How to Choose a SEO-friendly Domain Name">How to Choose a SEO-friendly Domain Name</h2>
    <p>The answer to the question "how to choose a good domain?" can be different for everyone, since each case is
      individual. The goals, approach and opportunities are individual. In each case, you need to choose a domain from
      several suitable options. To choose a good, SEO-friendly domain, you need to understand that there is no perfect
      option, but there is always a suitable one.</p>
    <p>To understand which domain is better to choose for your case, first decide on the goals and capabilities:</p>
    <ul class="dots">
      <li>Region and your target audience</li>
      <li>Which traffic sources will your site target: SEO, direct traffic, email campaigns, or contextual
        advertising.
      </li>
      <li>How your site will be promoted: by key queries or perhaps brand promotion. This will help you understand how
        to choose a domain name.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>How to choose the right domain name for your website depends on the benefits it will bring to your visitors.
      Among other things, the length and simplicity of the domain is also important, as a clear and short domain is
      easier to remember and enter manually.</p>
    <p>Let’s list the main criteria for SEO domains that will help business flourish.</p>
    <h4>Branding domains</h4>
    <p>The domain name that matches the brand name is identified by search engines as one of the brand factors, which
      allows the site to get the first place in the search results. Using a domain with a brand name, you will get more
      trust, recognition, and therefore, conversions to the site, which will have a positive effect on behavioral
      factors.</p>
    <h4>Keyword domains</h4>
    <p>A domain name that matches the key request exactly allows you to get the first position on Google. That is, if
      you choose a domain that exactly matches the popular keyword, you will get a better chance of reaching top-notch
      SEO indicators. The exact match of the domain name to the keyword indicates that on your site the visitor is more
      likely to find what they are looking for.</p>
    <h4>Domain length</h4>
    <p>The maximum domain length cannot exceed 63 characters, and you don’t really need that many. First of all, the
      domain should be memorable. It is better to use no more than 10 characters for a good and easy-to-remember name.
      But what if the company has a long name with several words?</p>
    <p>You can use abbreviations or come up with a word that represents your business. If you want to create a name from
      two short words or abbreviations, remember that a period is a separator between domain levels and cannot be used
      like a regular character. For visual separation, you can use a hyphen or no separators at all. But try not to pile
      up, limit yourself to two, maximum three words.</p>
    <p>Despite the fact that many domains contain numbers and hyphens, experts still do not recommend using them. The
      reason is such domains are less perceived by users and search engines. It is more difficult for people to memorize
      them and it is more difficult to type.</p>
    <h4>Domain name history</h4>
    <p>For fast business promotion, it is recommended to get drop domains, or domains with history. If the name of the
      site was created a long time ago, crawlers will treat it with great confidence. It has some benefits, including
      that you can quickly bring the resource to the top. Domain history is reset to zero only if it has not had an
      owner for a long time.</p>
    <p>It is recommended to consider domains that have been renewed for a long time and belonged to the same owner. Such
      names will cost more, but their quality will be much higher. They will speed up the promotion process several
      times.</p>
    <p>If you decide to get a drop domain for your website, you have to make sure that the chosen domain has a clear
      history. There are several free web services that allow you to check a domain name’s history and see if it has
      ever been tied to an adult, gambling, or any other 18+ themed website. If you have found out that a domain has a
      bad reputation, you should look for a new one. Domains with bad history won’t work for your SEO and mostly are
      banned from search engines.</p>
    <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Choosing a domain name is a big responsibility that determines the fate of your site. No matter how successfully
      and professionally the site is developed, a domain that wasn’t chosen properly may affect it really badly.
      Especially, if we are talking about the connection between SEO promotion and a domain name. You can see that a
      good domain can be a real assistant in terms of site promotion.</p>
    <p>Be careful and keep in mind all the tips we’ve given you to create a website that will benefit you!</p>
