    <p>Using drop domains is a common practice nowadays. You might think that if a domain was dropped or abandoned, then
      it means that it’s bad or etc. However, the reasons may be completely different: the business was closed and the
      site was simply hammered, the site owner forgot to renew the registration or did not want to do this. But how can
      an abandoned domain be useful in terms of promotion?</p>

    <h2 id="What is a Drop Domain?" style="margin-top:100px">What is a Drop Domain?</h2>
    <p>As you know, a domain cannot be bought, but it can be registered for a certain period. The registration period
      depends on the domain zone. For example, the maximum registration period in national zones is usually 1 year, and
      in international zones it is 10 years.
    </p>
    <p>When the registration period ends, the renewal period begins. During this period, the administrator decides
      whether it should be renewed. By the way, the administrator can renew the domain in advance, while it is in the
      registration period.</p>
    <p>Domains gain ratings, citation indexes, and search positions during the course of their network existence. These
      indications are kept when a new administrator registers a domain and creates a new site on it. If the drop domain
      has a strong reputation, such a purchase will help you save money and effort on website advertising. Often, drop
      domains are used by SEO specialists to create satellites and Private Blog Network.</p>

    <h2 id="Drop Domains Search Methods">Drop Domains Search Methods</h2>
    <p>We have figured out why you should use a drop domain. Now, the question is how to buy a domain name that is
      taken? There are several main ways to search and get it, let's break them down.</p>
    <h4>Drop domains catching services</h4>
    <p>You can use domain drop catching software for finding and leasing the drop domain you like. But before we
      proceed, let’s consider what types of drop domains exist.</p>
    <ul class="dots">
      <li>Released domains</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After the expiration of the domain registration period, the owner is given 30 days to renew the registration, and
      if they don’t do it, there’s an auction. If your bid was the highest, after the Free-Date (the date the domain
      will be available for purchase), the domain is yours.</p>
    <ul class="dots">
      <li>Exempt domains</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These domains do not require you to participate in auctions and wait for Free-Date to buy them.</p>
    <p>Now, let's move on to services.</p>
    <p>The most popular service for finding drops is ExpiredDomains.net. It provides the ability to configure the
      necessary settings to search for vacated domains.</p>
    <p>To do this, you just need to use a simple search filter, specifying the parameters you need. The service provides
      brief information about the sites, but you still have to double-check it.</p>
    <p>Another popular service is Mydrop.io. This is a service for finding released and already exempt domains. One of
      the advantages is the ability to restore a site that was previously at this address for little money.</p>
    <h4>Manual search</h4>
    <p>This method allows us to find better quality domains. Usually, these domains are not available in the services
      described above. If you want to use this method, you’ll need to search for drops from other sites.</p>
    <p>Let's say we need a domain that has links from trust news or information resources, or from trust sites on a
      specific topic. What are we doing?</p>
    <p>First, we need to get a list of sites and links.</p>
    <p>Second, insert the list of URLs into any parser service. The main thing is to disable all checkboxes in the
      settings, except for backlinks.</p>
    <p>Once the process is done, you get a list of trust websites that you can choose from and buy.</p>
    <h4>How to hijack a drop domain?</h4>
    <p>In fact, hijacking drop domains is a whole art. It is important not only to quickly respond to emerging domains,
      but also to properly validate them and then evaluate them.</p>
    <p><strong>Look for drops in specific locations</strong></p>
    <p>You can monitor all services for drop domains. But most often, affiliates and webmasters use 2-3 sites, which
      periodically monitor the necessary domain names. You can set up automatic crawling to find the domains you
      want.</p>
    <p><strong>Look for matching title and topic</strong></p>
    <p>Matching topic and name is probably the most crucial fact. There is no point in promoting a site about Hollywood
      on the usapresident.com domain. A domain name that matches your niche looks more attractive in search engine
      results, and it doesn’t cause users to experience cognitive dissonance.</p>
    <p><strong>Check all the features</strong></p>
    <p>Domains have many different attributes or features, and each of them can affect the process of bringing a site to
      the top of search engine results. What do you need to watch to make the right decision? There are some crucial
      parameters:</p>
    <ul class="dots">
      <li>Search engine visibility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One of the main criteria that allows you to refuse inappropriate domains at the beginning of checks. Just type in
      the domain name into the search engine line, and if there are no results, the domain is problematic.</p>
    <ul class="dots">
      <li>Links</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a site is referenced by many sources and resources, this gives it an advantage when evaluating by search
      engines. It is important that these sources are relevant to you and that they are not spam resources.</p>
    <ul class="dots">
      <li>Blacklists</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the domain is on the black list, you can revive it, but it is better to abandon this venture and use a drop
      with a normal history. You can check the availability in an emergency in special services like MXtoolbox</p>
    <p>The better all these indicators, the more profitable it will be to buy a drop. If it is only 1–2 years old, it is
      blacklisted or does not produce search results, as well as links, it is better to look for another option.</p>
    <h2 id="How to Check a Drop Domain">How to Check a Drop Domain</h2>
    <p>Registrar companies do not indicate whether the domain was in use or not. This check is carried out
      independently. This is not difficult to do. Once you've come up with a site name and made sure it's free, visit
      archive.org. It is a global web archive that stores the history of every Internet resource. Here you can see how
      the site looked from the moment of the first registration, and track the entire history of domain name
      changes.</p>
    <h2 id="Pros & Cons of Registering a Drop Domain"></h2>
    <p>Choosing the right drop domain will give you the following benefits:</p>
    <ul class="dots">
      <li>A drop domain may just have a beautiful and sonorous name that you can keep for yourself or use for resale;
      </li>
      <li>A domain can have a long registration history and your site does not have to sit in the search engine
        sandbox;
      </li>
      <li>A drop can have a good link mass, allowing it to be utilized as the foundation of your site. Drops are
        frequently used to create PBN networks (networks of satellite sites whose primary goal is to transmit link mass
        to the promoted site), which is particularly significant for marketing;
      </li>
      <li>You don’t have to spend money on SEO-promotion or the expenses will be minimal;</li>
      <li>If the resource has backlinks, it has good citation indicators (TIC or PR).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cons of registering a drop domain include:</p>
    <ul class="dots">
      <li>The domain may be banned from Google. The domain has a "bad reputation". For example, the site was used to
        distribute prohibited materials, spam, or for fraudulent purposes;
      </li>
      <li>Domain citation indicators (TIC or PR) are created by "gluing" with another domain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order for a drop domain to help with website promotion, you need to evaluate its quality.</p>
    <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Drop domains can have a good promotion effect. Use various services and auctions to find free domains. With a
      little effort, you can find better quality domains by parsing SERPs.</p>
